# Mediapipe_wrappers

This repo is for all my projects using [Mediapipe](https://github.com/google/mediapipe)  
which provides hand tracking, face mesh and pose tracking

### Video midi
Track hands and send midi data to the default midi device using Pygame  
right hand's fingertip position sets the note
left hand's fingertip position sets the note velocity
